## Travis Build
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/spencer517/python_calculator.svg?branch=stat_calculator)](https://travis-ci.com/spencer517/python_calculator)

This is a statistics calculator that was made using python and source controlled using git.
The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring a number, and finding the square root of a number.
New capabilities were added to the calculator which allows it to now find the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.The project also has automated unit tests.
